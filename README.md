👋 Hi, I’m @elias-faria,
In a world of tech, I’m here to play,
👀 I’m interested in all things bright,
From coding to gaming, oh what a delight! 🌱 I’m currently learning, oh yes indeed,
About networks and protocols, that’s my speed!
With TCP and HTTP, I’m on the track,
Diving deep into data, there’s no looking back. 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate, so come take a seat,
Let’s brainstorm together, make our ideas complete!
Whether it’s coding or crafting a tale,
In this grand adventure, we surely won’t fail. 📫 How to reach me? Just send me a line,
On X or Discord, I’ll be sure to shine!
Let’s connect and create, share knowledge galore,
In this vast sea of learning, there’s always more! Just so you know,
In this wondrous journey, let’s together grow! ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that cats can’t taste sweet?
Just like coding puzzles can sometimes feel neat!
So let’s share our quirks and our passions so grand,
In this whimsical world, let’s take a stand!
